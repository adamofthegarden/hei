# hei

Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scoring is not the simplest of calculations. This package contains a function to compute HEI total and component scores from ASA-24 hour diet recall data.


## Installation

You can install the released version of hei from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("hei")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AdamSadowski/hei")
```

## Example

`hei()` creates HEI variables for each row. It accepts a data frame and returns it with these added variables. 

```{r example}
library(hei)

asa.df <- read.csv("asa_example_df.csv")

asa.df
```



```{r}
df <- hei(asa.df)

df[, grep("X|HEI", names(df))]

```
